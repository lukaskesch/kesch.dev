            I have built multiple AI applications using Retrieval-Augmented
            Generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expand on the
            capabilities of LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            I actively use AI tools in my daily workflow. I love to use Claude
            and ChatGPT for learning and research. For coding I am always
            testing out the newest tools and am fascinated by the progress of
            AI.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Frontend</h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            My go to stack for the frontend is React, Next.js, TypeScript, and
            Tailwind CSS. For Mobile I use React Native with Expo.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            I have a deep understanding of the React principles, Hooks, when and
            why React re-renders. With Next.js I have both deployed the pages
            and app router and used the static generation and server side
            rendering.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            I keep a close eye on the react ecosystem and emerging trends.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Backend</h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Depending on the situation my go to solution are either Next.js
            Server Actions or a full fleshed Spring Boot application which
            serves as a REST API. I have used both extensively and learned their
            strengths and weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            In most cases I prefer SQL Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL over
            NoSQL databases like MongoDB. I have MySQL database for virtually
            all my projects and became proficient in crafting performant queries
            and modeling the database schema.

            I always found it fascinating how and on what the software we build
            is deployed. I can call AWS my home and have a deep understanding of
            over a dozen AWS services including EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda,
            CloudFront, Route 53, and many more.

            As a weekend getaway I also like to tinker with my own server. This

            cron scripts for backups, monitoring, and maintenance and many more.

          <p className="mt-2">
            I love to optimize my development workflow and tools I use. It all
            started when I learned about Vim Motions and from there I just kept
            going. Some things as basic as reading the git reference manual.
            Others include having a custom keyboard layout to maximise code
            typing speed.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            These are the tools I use to make my development workflow more

            or to automating recurring tasks.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            For simple tasks I stick with basic bash scripting with core utils
            sprinkled in. For more complex tasks I choose Node.js. Its fast to
            write and has a vast package ecosystem.
